Stock Market Predictions using a LSTM Neural Network.

This is a simple try at attempting to predict future stock market prices using Deep Learning. 
However, I do not encourage the use of this model at this moment for live trading. 
This model currently gives a basic estimation of where the stock prices are headed. 

Future updates include sentiment analysis of stock related data to help in more accurate prediction as well as 
taking into consideration the fundamentals of a stock. This is my part time project and support will be added as soon as I get the time!
